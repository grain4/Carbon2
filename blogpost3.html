  <h2>Some small changes that reduce your carbon footprint</h2>
  <p>
    A lasting and flourishing planet requires work from each and every one of us. As responsible consumers, every little lifestyle change we make adds up to create a significant impact on our environment. Here are some small but significant everyday changes you can make:
  </p>
<ol>
  <li>Consider renewable sources of energy. Granted, they can be slightly more expensive per unit consumed, it is a small cost that goes towards significantly reducing your carbon consumption.</li>
  <li>Opt for flights with low carbon emissions and eco-certified hotels when travelling.
  <li>Choose public transport, cycling and electric cars over conventional gas vehicles as much as possible.
  <li>Switch to LED bulbs. These consume less electricity and last longer than traditional incandescent bulbs.</li>
  <li>Opt for slow fashion brands. Also give your clothes another chance by donating them or taking part in clothes swaps.</li>
  <li>Shop at thrift stores for some great vintage pieces and give these unique finds a new life in your closet.</li>
  <li>Pick locally produced fruits and veggies. This produce travels a shorter distance to reach your neighbourhood stores and thus has a lower carbon footprint.</li>
</ol>
