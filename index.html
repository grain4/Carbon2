  <h2>Why should you care about Carbon?</h2>
  <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas because it accounts for the highest portion of global warming caused as a result of human activities. And the level of CO2 in the atmosphere is at at the highest it has ever been.</li>
  <li>Carbon is the building block of life on this planet. It exists throughout our biosphere.</li>
  <li>It exists in our atmosphere as Carbon Dioxide and Carbon Monoxide released by the oceans, plants, animals and through human activity.</li>
  <li>The oceans sequester (i.e. capture & store) carbon by dissolving atmospheric CO2 in water and through photosynthesis by mangroves, phytoplankton and other seagrass. The life cycle of aquatic animals also contribute to the storage of carbon in the ocean and ocean bed.</li> 
  <li>The land sequesters carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and stores it into the ground throughout the life cycle of plants & animals.</li>
  <li>The biggest consumer of carbon is humans through the use of coal, oil, and natural gas. And all this is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of our consumption of these natural sources of carbon.</li>
  </ul>
