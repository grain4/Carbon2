  <h2>Who are we?</h2>
  <p>Welcome to Carbon+, where we're committed to guiding you through the intricate landscape of the carbon economy. Our mission is to empower you with resources that simplify the process of reducing your carbon footprint, one manageable step at a time. While we advocate for corporations and manufacturers to transition to sustainable materials and fuels, we recognize that individual consumers have limitations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, we firmly believe in our collective responsibility to curb our consumption of organic fuels. From transportation choices to fabric preferences and household selections, every everyday decision matters. At Carbon+, we're not just here to inform; we're here to empathize and support you in making incremental changes that collectively create a significant impact. This initiative is proudly brought to you by the team at Near Zero.</p>
