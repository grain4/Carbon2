  <h2>Who are we?</h2>
  <p>At Carbon+, our goal is to shine a light on the Carbon economy and your carbon footprint in a manner that is fun and easy to understand. Our mission is to empower you with resources that help you reduce your carbon footprint. We believe it is mostly the corporations and manufacturers that can create measurable change at scale. We also understand that you have limitations to how much you can do for the planet. We empathise with you, the end user, who has to often make choices that arenâ€™t the most sustainable despite being aware of the environmental cost involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, we firmly believe it is our collective responsibility to work towards a healthier planet. At Carbon+, we're not just here to educate, we're here help you make small incremental changes that overtime will hopefully create a significant impact.
